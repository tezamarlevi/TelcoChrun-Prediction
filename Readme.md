# **Prediction Customer Churn**
---
## Telco Chrun
In this project, I created a classification model using Deep Neural Network by comparing the number of hidden layers, activation functions, and optimizers.

1. Create a model to determine whether the customer will churn or not
2. Performed 6 model experiments by changing the number of hidden layers, activation function and optimizer
3. Modeling using Deep Neural Network with Functional API
4. The metric used in this case is Recall to reduce False Negative
5. The result of the Classification Report Recall score is 0.79
6. Libraries used by Pandas, Tensorflow, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scipy
